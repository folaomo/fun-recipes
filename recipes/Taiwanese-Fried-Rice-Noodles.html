    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You'll most likely find all the ingredients at your local supermarket except for the five spice powder,  <br>
            dried Chinese black mushrooms and rice vermicelli which can be found at your local Asian food mart. <br>
            All the measurements here are pretty much to taste, some people like more pork, some less, some more soy sauce, some less, etc.
        </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound thinly sliced pork loin</li>

            <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            
            <li>¼ cup rice wine</li>

            <li>1 (8 ounce) package dried rice vermicelli</li>  
            
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, divided</li> 
            
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li> 
            
            <li> ¼ clove garlic, minced</li>
            
            <li>1 tablespoon dried small shrimp</li>
            
            <li>3 carrots, cut into matchstick strips</li> 
            
            <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
            
            <li>3 cups bean sprouts</li>
            
            <li>4 leaves napa cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
            
            <li>salt to taste</li> 
            
            <li>3 sprigs fresh cilantro for garnish</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the pork into a mixing bowl and pour in the soy sauce and rice wine. <br>
                Sprinkle with the white pepper, five-spice powder, and cornstarch. <br>
                 Mix well, then set aside to marinate. Soak the mushrooms in a bowl of cold water for 20 minutes, <br>
                 then pour off the water, cut off and discard the stems of the mushrooms. <br>
                 Slice the mushrooms thinly and reserve. Soak the rice vermicelli in a separate bowl of cold water for 10 minutes, <br>
                then pour off the water and set the noodles aside.
            </li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. <br>
                 Pour in the eggs, and cook until firm, flipping once, to make a pancake. <br>
                 Remove the egg pancake, and allow to cool, then thinly slice and place into a large bowl. <br>
                 Heat 2 more tablespoons of the vegetable oil in the wok over high heat. <br>
                 Stir in the garlic and dried shrimp, and cook until the shrimp become aromatic, about 20 seconds. <br>
                 Next, add the pork along with the marinade, and cook until the pork is no longer pink, about 4 minutes. <br>
                 Stir in the carrots and onion, and cook until the carrots begin to soften, about 3 minutes. <br>
                Finally, add the bean sprouts, napa cabbage, and sliced mushrooms; <br>
                cook and stir until the vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes more. <br>
                Scrape the pork mixture into the bowl along with the eggs, <br>
                then wipe out the wok and return it to the stove over medium-high heat.
            </li>
            <li>Heat the remaining vegetable oil in the wok, then stir in the drained rice vermicelli noodles. <br>
                Cook and stir for a few minutes until the noodles soften, then stir in the reserved pork mixture. <br>
                 Scrape the mixture in to a serving bowl and garnish with cilantro to serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
