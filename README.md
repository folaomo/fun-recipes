This project is to build a basic recipe website
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

To accomplish this:
1. I created a repository on github and cloned the repository into the repos folder on my local machine using the "git clone" command
2. I will be using the following git commands 

    Commands related to a remote repository:
        git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
        git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)

    Commands related to the workflow:
        git add . - to add my codes to staging area
        git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different" - to commit(save my code)

    Commands related to checking status or log history
        git status - to check the status of my code
        git log - to check the logs of my code
